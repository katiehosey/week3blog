#R Package

For my R package last week, my partner, Vee (who knows much more about computer science than I do and definitely loves it WAY more than I do) and I made an R package that converts data frames into tibbles. It was a fairly simple code, but useful. Tibbles are beneficial for portraying the data in a more organized way, without changing any of the information. Extracting the data from a tibble is also easier and more intuitive. Tibbles are important for tidy data, which was given the utmost importance by Julia Silge in her talk on text mining and visualization (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uVo0Xvmimw). Overall the package was not complex, but sometimes the simple things made even simpler with a package can be very helpful.
